00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Adam] Hello, my name is Adam Wilbert,

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:03.01
and I'd like to welcome you

3
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:05.04
to Learning Relational Databases.

4
00:00:05.04 --> 00:00:07.00
In this course, I'm going
to give you an overview

5
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:08.09
of the planning steps that
you should move through

6
00:00:08.09 --> 00:00:11.00
before you start development
in order to ensure

7
00:00:11.00 --> 00:00:13.02
that your system works as expected.

8
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:15.00
I'll start with an
overview of what exactly

9
00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:17.09
a relational database is and
how its structure differs

10
00:00:17.09 --> 00:00:18.07
from the spreadsheets

11
00:00:18.07 --> 00:00:20.03
that you might be used to working with.

12
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:22.03
And I'll outline some of
the hidden difficulties

13
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:24.01
that can arise if the
structure of your data

14
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:27.02
isn't fully considered
before development begins.

15
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:30.00
Then we'll discover the
database development lifecycle

16
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:32.05
and use it as a guide for
moving through the process

17
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.04
of thinking about our
specific data storage needs.

18
00:00:35.04 --> 00:00:36.09
Finally, we'll talk about all of the rules

19
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:38.06
that we've identified
about how the database

20
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:40.06
needs to function and
start translating them

21
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:41.09
into the components that will make up

22
00:00:41.09 --> 00:00:44.02
the actual relational database.

23
00:00:44.02 --> 00:00:46.05
And along the way, we'll
discuss design considerations

24
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:48.03
that'll make the database
easier to construct

25
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:50.05
and easier to maintain.

26
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:52.00
So I'd like to thank you for joining me

27
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:53.07
in learning relational databases.

28
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:55.04
Now let's get started.

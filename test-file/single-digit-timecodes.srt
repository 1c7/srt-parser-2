- [Adam] Hello, my name is Adam Wilbert,

2
0:0:9,700 --> 0:0:10,520
and I'd like to welcome you

3
0:0:10,840 --> 0:0:12,530
to Learning Relational Databases.

4
0:0:12,530 --> 0:0:14,570
In this course, I'm going
to give you an overview

5
0:0:15,250 --> 0:0:18,540
of the planning steps that
you should move through

6
0:0:18,570 --> 0:0:21,350
before you start development
in order to ensure

7
0:0:21,360 --> 0:0:22,620
that your system works as expected.

8
0:0:22,620 --> 0:0:24,830
I'll start with an
overview of what exactly

9
0:0:24,830 --> 0:0:27,490
a relational database is and
how its structure differs

10
0:0:27,530 --> 0:0:28,340
from the spreadsheets
